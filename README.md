# maintenance_schema

A DBA framework for postgres using views. 

* 0.0.4 is corrected for PG12
* Default is version 0.0.3 intended for PG10, PG11 ~~and higher~~. 
* Version 0.0.2 for versions 9.4 to 9.6.
* Version 0.0.1 for version 9.3.

NOTE: To change version of installation, modify the default version in `maintenance_schema.control` before install.

# INSTALL

Put `.sql` and `.control` files in the extension folder.

Use `CREATE EXTENSION` in the wanted database(s).

## **WARNING**: log out and back in for the schema to be loaded in the current user path.

## **NOTE**: intended for postgres user or user with SUPER.

* `rpt_` views are meant as information 
* `audit_` views serve as warnings 
* `dba_` views contain DDL/DML statement (just \gexec it !)

## USAGE of full_report 
NOTE : use in shell to have a "nice" html report
`psql -At -d pgbench -c "select concat(sql_statement , ';') from maintenance_schema.full_report  " | psql -d pgbench -H  -o fullrpt.html`

or

~~~
\H
\C 'FULL REPORT'
\o fullrpt.html
 select sql_statement from maintenance_schema.full_report \gexec
~~~

**WARNING**:
Bloat and fine bloat views might give significant different results (1 order of magnitude for instance). 




VERSION COMPATIBILITY
=====================

All views should be compatible from 9.5 and up.
Some views might be compatible starting with 9.4.
I will try to maintain all currently supported versions.
